Sure, here's an excerpt from "The Forty Rules of Love" by Elif Shafak, which beautifully captures the essence of love and spirituality:
"Every true love and friendship is a story of unexpected transformation. If we are the same person before and after we loved, that means we haven't loved enough. Love transforms. Love heals. Love sets us free. It is the water of life.
 And a lover is a soul of fire! The universe turns differently when fire and water meet.
